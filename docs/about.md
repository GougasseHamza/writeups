# About

## About This Site

This site is a collection of CTF (Capture The Flag) writeups documenting my journey through various cybersecurity challenges. Each writeup aims to be educational, providing not just solutions but also explanations of the underlying security concepts and techniques.

## About Me

I'm a security enthusiast passionate about:

- Web application security
- Penetration testing
- Vulnerability research
- CTF competitions

## Why CTF Writeups?

Writing detailed writeups serves multiple purposes:

1. **Learning Reinforcement** - Writing about a technique helps solidify understanding
2. **Knowledge Sharing** - Helping others learn from my solutions
3. **Documentation** - Creating a reference for future challenges
4. **Community Contribution** - Giving back to the security community

## Writeup Philosophy

My writeups follow these principles:

- **Detailed but Clear** - Enough detail to understand without overwhelming
- **Working Code** - All exploit code is tested and functional
- **Educational Focus** - Emphasis on learning, not just solving
- **Responsible Disclosure** - Only publishing after CTF end dates

## Topics Covered

This site currently features writeups on:

- Web Exploitation (SSRF, XSS, CRLF Injection, LFI, Path Traversal)
- Application Security (CSP Bypass, IDOR, Authentication Bypass)
- Python Security (Sandbox Escapes, Expression Injection)
- Filter Evasion (Unicode Normalization, Case Sensitivity)

## Adding New Writeups

This site is built with [MkDocs Material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) and is easy to extend. See the [Contributing Guide](https://github.com/GougasseHamza/writeups) for details on adding new writeups.
